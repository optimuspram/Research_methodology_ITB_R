# Research_methodology_ITB_R
This repository contains the collection of PDF files (generated using R Markdown) that I use to teach "Research Methodology" at the Faculty of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, ITB. Here are some pointers:
- Module 0: Introduction to basic syntax in R. You need to try this if you are not familiar with R.
- Module 1: Descriptive Statistics using R
- Module 2: Data visualization and plotting using R.
- Module 3: Statistical test using R (t-test)
- Module 4: ANOVA test using R

For the teaching material, please download "Research_methodology_teaching_slides.pdf".

The CSV and XLSX files are used in some of the modules.
